**Windows Installation**
- Download Godot Mono Version
- Download MSBuild
	- If VS is installed, MSBuild is already installed in your machine
	- .NET Build Tools
	- ![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/UmPQI4L.png)
- When attaching new script
	- C# is available from dropdown menu
	- Godot's built in script editor shouldn't be used
		- Options are:
			- VSCode
				- Needs extension (like all others text editors I believe)
			- MonoDevelop
			- VS
			- Resharper
			- Atom
			- Sublime
			- Etc..
		- Change default editor: `Editor Settings > Mono > Editor > External Editor`
		- After opening a script, it'll open on the selected default editor instead of Godot's
	- Main differences when developing:
		- `CamelCase` instead of `snake_case`
		- Globals are accessed via  `GD.`
			- i.e. `print()` vs `GD.Print()`
