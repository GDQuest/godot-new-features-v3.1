# Godot 3.1 New Features Tutorial

Tutorial series and demos to learn the new features in Godot 3.1. A Free and Open Source series we're building for the official Godot documentation and the community.

## The project

We're looking to cover most of the major new features in Godot 3.1. The tutorials will be available on the [GDquest YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/c/gdquest), and the full series will be available to download and redistribute, DRM-free, from the official manual.

There are tons of changes in Godot 3.1. More than we can cover in a single series. For instance, there's been major improvements to the networking API, and you can now process video streams in real-time using FFmpeg and GDNative. Once again, VR and AR got some love.

### Planned tutorials include...

1. **Animation**: new animation editor, blend trees, animation state machines, blend spaces, bezier curves, root motion
1. **Redesigned editor**: tour of the new UI, inspector, filesystem, 2d viewport, 3d viewport
1. **2d tools**: tileset editor, 2d meshes, 2d mesh deform and skeletons, KinematicBody2d snap and raycast
1. **3d tools**: Constructive Solid Geometry, softbody physics, ragdoll, Blender gltf exporter
1. **GDScript**: optional static typing and warning system, class_name, find and replace in all files
1. **Programming**: visual shader editor, C# progress and intro tutorial
1. **GLES 2.0** rendering backend
